# Trivial Movie Trivia! #

How much do you know about movies? Answer these movie trivia questions before the time runs out! :movie_camera:

## What this project does ## 

This project contains movie trivia questions in a simple `object` and a separate object for the game `timer`. This project makes use of `jQuery` to manipulate the `DOM` (to display questions, answers, and the endgame scorecard). User input is collected with `on-click functions`.

## How users can get started with this project ## 

### How to Play: ###

1. **[Start the game](https://chereenielson.github.io/TriviaGame/)**.
    - Press the "Start" button to reveal your list of trivial movie questions.

2. **Select your answers before time runs out**.
    - Under each question, four possible answers will display. Select your answer before moving on to the next question.

3. **Check your score**.
    - Your trivia scores will appear after you've answered all questions. How did you do?
    
4. **Play again**!
    - Refresh the page and play again, as many times as you'd like.
